# Checkpoint MVC

Checkpoint was created to house information about Video Games and allows users to add and review their favorite games. The MVC has three primary database tables in addition to the user data. The main games table houses the basic information of the game pertaining to the Title, Description, Maturity Rating, Platform and other basic info of the facility. The platform table contains the details pertaining to the platforms that the games are played on.. The third main data table pertains to reviews of the games where a user can rate the game on a scale of 1 to 10,  and leave text comments.

Checkpoint is written in C#, an object-oriented programming language from Microsoft designed to work with their .Net platform. Front end is built with HTML &CSS and Bootstrap 3.4.1.

## Directions

- For the best experience using Checkpoint, I recommend utilizing the deployed web application: (https://thecheckpoint.azurewebsites.net/Game).

- Register and login to access the app. 

- In the Games Library you can add, edit, and review your favorite games.

- **If you choose to edit a game, you must re-add the Game Image otherwise it will save the game Image as null in the Game's library and the image will not display.**

- In the platforms library you can add and edit all gaming platforms you can think of.

- In the reviews table you can create reviews for any games inside the games library!

- **You cannot delete a game that has a review attached to it. This is to prevent someone delete a game that someone else has done the work to create a review.**

Enjoy the application!

**Note:**  There are still multiple bugs I am aware of and working to fix. Thank you for your patience.

## Contributing
